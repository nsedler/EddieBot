Hello I am trying to write a command object for a discord bot I am working on
I am having trouble implementing it however since rust doesn't have real objects.

I want every command to have 3 options, `cmd: String, aliases: Vec<string>, help: String`.  So i made a struct like this:
```rust
pub struct Command {
    cmd: String,
    aliases: Vec<String>,
    help: String
}
```

And every command should be executed using the `execute` funcion so I made a trait like this:
```rust
pub trait Execute {
    fn execute(&self, ctx: Context, msg: Message);
}
```

I also have a `Command::new()` function that returns a Command struct.  I'm not sure how I can dynamically create new Commands and impl the Execute trait.
Any help would be appreciated, sorry if this quetion is worded poorly or I missed out on some details I should have included, if I have please mention me.
